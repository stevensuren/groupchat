    <h1>Hi Group Chat!</h1>
    <h2>That's right. White font on a black background LIKE A BOSS.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>You know what else is Boss? Myspace. <a href="https://myspace.com/scubaparkwaycrisis">Check out this sweet local band, Scuba Parkway Crisis</a></h2>
    <br>
    <p>So, some of you seem to like making up excuses for not hanging out. I figured I'd save you some time and list a few excuses you can use for next time we all want to get together:</p><ul>
      <li>I need to make a sandwich but I can't remember my bolgna's first name</li>
      <li>I just had one of those huge meals that skips the digestion phase and goes straight to post-food shit time with a possible follow-up meeting 20 minutes later</li>
      <li>I'm solipsistic so really I'm just saying no to myself. Impulse control for the win!</li>
      <li>I rolled a crit failure</li>
      <li>Dwight thinks it's Friday, so that's what I'll be doing today</li>

      <li>I've got 99 problems and they're all bitches</li>

    <p>What the critics are saying:</p>
    <h4>"That's a horrific and beautiful website all at once" - Michael</h4>
    <h4>"Oh nice. That's like nostalgia overload." - Jordan</h4>
    <h4>"When is our next practice?" - Alex</h4><br>

    <h2>And now I'm just shamlessly plugging Jordan's music while using the excuse that I only wanted to test a sound cloud embedding (lolz)<br>
